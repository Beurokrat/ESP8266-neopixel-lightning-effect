## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- An ESP8266 microcontroller (e.g., NodeMCU, Wemos D1 Mini)
- A NeoPixel strip
- A breadboard and jumper wires
- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) installed

## Installation

1. **Install PlatformIO**: If you haven't already, install PlatformIO. It's an open-source ecosystem for IoT development that supports ESP8266 and many other platforms.

2. **Clone this repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Beurokrat/ESP8266-neopixel-lightning-effect.git
   cd yourrepository
   ```

3. **Open the Project in PlatformIO**: Open the project in your preferred IDE that supports PlatformIO (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Atom).

4. **Select Board**: In the PlatformIO toolbar, select your ESP8266 board.

5. **Upload the Code**: Click the "Upload" button in the PlatformIO toolbar to compile and upload the code to your ESP8266.

## Usage

Once the code is uploaded, the NeoPixel strip will display a lightning effect. You can adjust the effect by modifying the parameters in the `src/main.cpp` file.
